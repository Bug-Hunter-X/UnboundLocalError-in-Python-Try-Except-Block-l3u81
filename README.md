This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes overlooked error in Python: the UnboundLocalError within a try-except block.  The `bug.py` file contains code that will raise this error, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version. This is a crucial example to illustrate how variable scope is affected by exception handling, offering insights for developers working with Python exception mechanisms.
